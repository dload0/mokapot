# MokaPot

[![Cargo Build & Test](https://github.com/henryhchchc/mokapot/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/henryhchchc/mokapot/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

MokaPot is a Java byte code analysis library to facilitate my research.

This project is in an early development stage and stability is not the current focus.
I will add the documentation stuff when the basic functionalities are ready for use.
